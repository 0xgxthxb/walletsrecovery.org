# CASA Hodl Recovery informatin

## Finding your recovery data

In Sovereign Recovery, you should operate on the assumption that the Casa Recovery Key is unavailable, meaning you have 4-of-5 or 2-of-3 signing keys left.  To complete a transaction, you need all of your public keys.

To find your public keys - All your public keys can be downloaded directly from Keymaster.  Just tap the key icon from your Key Shield screen, then tap View Public Keys. With your hardware wallets, it's important to use the public keys displayed by your Keymaster app, rather than the ones exposed by a hardware manufacturer's app. The account-level public keys used by Casa are distinct from the devices' root public keys.

Don't forget to copy the derivation paths - When you view the public key for a specific account on a device, the current derivation path will be displayed beneath it. Derivation paths change every time you add a new device to your keymaster; it’s important that you use the current path, otherwise the wrong addresses will be generated by your recovery wallet software.

To access your Mobile Key seed - tap into the Mobile Key icon on your Key Shield, then tap Export Private Key. NOTE - Once you export your Mobile Key seed, it is marked as compromised as a precaution, and you can no longer use your Mobile Key to sign transactions through the Keymaster app.
 
IMPORTANT - Your public keys and Mobile Key seed are secured locally on your iOS or Android phone. Meaning they can be downloaded even if Casa's infrastructure is unavailable, and even if your device does not have an active Internet connection. To ensure you’re able to log into Keymaster even if you're offline, you must NOT enable the "clear cache on logout" option.

## Casa Covenant recovery

First, gather your recovery data from either your Sovereign Recovery email or from the Keymaster app as described above.

Install the latest version of Electrum: https://electrum.org/#download.
Electrum 4.0.0 or later is required for Coldcard support.

## Linux Only

Install the appropriate libraries for your hardware wallets:

1. `sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev`
2. `sudo pip3 install btchip-python`
3. `sudo pip3 install trezor`
4. `sudo pip3 install ckcc-protocol`
5. Set udev rules for ledger: https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues
6. Set udev rules for trezor: https://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-user/settingupchromeonlinux.html
7. Set udev rules for coldcard: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Coldcard/ckcc-protocol/master/51-coinkite.rules
8. After setting the udev rules for the first time, reboot your computer.

## Step-By-Step Guide

1. Run electrum. For testnet, run `electrum --testnet`.
2. Create a new wallet and give it a name.
3. Choose "multi-signature wallet".
4. Select "From 6 cosigners".
5. Select "Require 3 signatures".
6. Click next.

### For cosigner 1 of 6:

1. Choose "hardware wallet".
2. Plug in hardware device 1 if it isn't already plugged in.
3. Click next.
4. Select your hardware device and click next.
5. Select p2sh-segwit multisig.
   - The derivation path should change to something like: `m/48'/0'/0'/1'`. Replace it with the derivation path from your recovery data, which will look something like: `m/49/0/0`.
6. Click next, then next again on the master public key screen.

### For cosigner 2 of 6:

1. Choose "cosign with hardware device".
2. Plug in hardware device 2 if it isn't already plugged in.
3. Click next.
4. Select your hardware device and click next.
5. Select p2sh-segwit multisig.
   - The derivation path should change to something like: `m/48'/1'/0'/1'`. Replace it with the derivation path from your recovery data.
6. Click next.

### For cosigner 3 of 6:

If you’re signing using the Mobile Key:

1. Select "I already have a seed"
2. Click next
3. Type the seed phrase into the box
4. Click "Options"
5. Check "BIP39 seed"
6. Click "OK"
7. Click "Next"
8. Select "p2sh-segwit (p2wpkh-p2sh)"
9. The derivation path should change to something like m/48'/0'/0'/1' - replace it with the derivation path from your recovery data, which will look something like: m/49/0/0
10. Click "Next"

If you're signing with a third hardware device:

1. Choose "cosign with hardware device".
2. Plug in hardware device 3 if it isn't already plugged in.
3. Click next.
4. Select your hardware device and click next.
5. Select p2sh-segwit multisig.
   - The derivation path should change to something like `m/48'/1'/0'/1'`. Replace it with the derivation path from your recovery data.
6. Click next.

### For cosigner 4 of 6:

1. Choose "Enter cosigner key" and click next.
2. If you are signing with 3 hardware devices, paste the "Mobile Device Public Key" for the appropriate account from your recovery data. If you imported the Mobile Key seed phrase earlier, paste the Public Key for a hardware device with which you are not signing. If you accidentally paste in a public key for one of the hardware devices you already added, you will see a "duplicate key" error.
3. Click next.

### For cosigner 5 of 6:

1. Choose "Enter cosigner key" and click next.
2. Paste your final unused hardware Device Key for the appropriate account from your recovery data.
3. Click next.

### For cosigner 6 of 6:

1. Choose "Enter cosigner key" and click next.
2. Paste the "Recovery Device Key" for the appropriate account from your recovery data.
3. Click next.
4. On the password screen, leave both fields blank and click next.

Electrum will now initialize your wallet and display all of the transactions that have been received and sent by it. If you don't see your transactions show up after a minute or so, something went wrong during the process and Electrum derived the wrong set of addresses.

To send your assets to a new wallet, click on the "send" tab and fill in the "pay to" field with and address owned by your new wallet. Click the "max" button to sweep all of the value out of the wallet, and slide the "fee" bar to an appropriate fee depending upon your urgency.

Once you click "send" you will be prompted to confirm the amount and destination address on each hardware device.

Upon completing the third signature, the "broadcast" button will no longer be greyed out. Click "broadcast" and then copy the transaction id into a block explorer to check that the transaction has propagated across the network.

NOTE: Electrum can be finicky with hardware signing device support, especially on Linux. In order to prevent errors, ensure that you only have ONE electrum instance running and plug ALL of your hardware devices in simultaneously rather than plugging and unplugging the devices as you sign.
