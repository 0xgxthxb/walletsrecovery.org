# wallets-info

**Giving users their seed is not all.**

This list is meant to gather information about wallet defaults for external recovery.

Users should not have to digg or read the source code of a wallet to figure-out the Derivation Path or Redeem Scripts. 

If I went to your website and couldn't find it => ☠️ [EXTERNAL RECOVERY NOT DOCUMENTED]
